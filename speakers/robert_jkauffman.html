						<p>Robert J. Kauffman is Professor of IS, Assoc. Dean (Faculty), Deputy Director (Living Analytics Res. Ctr.), and was Assoc. Dean (Research) at Singapore Mgmt. Univ. (SMU), School of Info. Sys. (SIS). He teaches in the Masters of IT in Business (Financial Services) on banking products and processes, and Ph.D. Program. He visited the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth, was W.P. Carey Chair in IS at Arizona State Univ., and was Professor and Chair (Info. and Dec. Sci.), and Director (MIS Res. Ctr.) at U. Minnesota. He also served at the Stern School of Business, NYU. His graduate degrees are from Cornell and Carnegie. He won Singapore Management University’s 2012-2013 Lee Kuan Yew Faculty Research Excellence Award. This award helped to fund data analytics research on ‘consumer informedness’ that appeared in INFORMS Information Systems Research in 2014, and was nominated by CIONet Europe for the ‘2015 European Research Paper of the Year.’ More recently, his work on estimating the impact of series drama freemiums and customer conversion to paid video-on- demand dramas was selected as the ‘Best Paper’ of the ‘Impacts of IT on Consumer Activities and on Business Operations’ Mini-Track at the 2016 Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences. </p>

						<h3>UNDERSTANDING TIME, SPACE, PROXIMITY AND VALUE FOR SMARTER FINANCE: AN INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH PERSPECTIVE ON DATA ANALYTICS</h3>
						<h4>Last revised: March 14, 2016</h4>

						<p>
							The frontier of big data analytics research in the financial services domain is increasingly character-ized by efforts to create innovative new results from an interdisciplinary fusion of multiple perspec-tives in research, with increasing reliance on Computer Science. This presentation will explore what we are learning from recent efforts involving researchers at Singapore Management University’s Liv-ing Analytics Research Centre (LARC), in its Pinnacle Lab (a joint venture with Ping An Technology Pte. Ltd. of Shenzhen), and with some of our other research sponsors. These create the basis for dis-cussing new issues and trends from current research related to social networks, credit card deals and rewards, faster settlement of electronic payments, and bellwether patterns in global financial networks. The goal of the presentation is not to share highly sensitive proprietary findings, or detailed results: our research has been conducted under binding non-disclosure agreements. Instead, we will focus on some emerging themes including: social network analytics-based learning in the marketing of finan-cial services products; machine learning and pattern recognition to extract national economy-level information from bilateral payment flows; and optimizing liquidity usage for ‘3D payment settlement’ to simultaneously optimize the time to settlement, the amount of funds involved, and the likelihood for irrevocable intraday and overnight payment settlement.
