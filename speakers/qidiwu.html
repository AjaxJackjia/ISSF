She does academic research in control theory and intelligent system for many years. She published more than 200 academic papers, wrote and interpreted seven books and completed over twenty research projects, seven of which won Provincial, Ministerial and State awards.</p>
						<p>Because of her outstanding work, she was rewarded with a number awards including an Outstanding Young and Middle-aged Expert Award from the Ministry of Personnel in 1996; an Excellent Overseas Returned Scholar Award in 1997 and a National Ten Outstanding Women Award in 1998.
