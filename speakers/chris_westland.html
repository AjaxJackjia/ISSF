						<p>I am currently Professor in the Department of Information & Decision Sciences at the University of Illinois – Chicago. I have a BA in Statistics and an MBA in Accounting from Indiana University and received my PhD in Computers and Information Systems from the University of Michigan. I have professional experience in the US as a certified public accountant and as a consultant in technology law in the US, Europe, Latin America and Asia.  I am the author of numerous academic papers and of seven books:  Global Electronic Commerce (MIT Press 2000); Global Innovation Management (Palgrave Macmillan 2nd ed 2015; 2008); Red Wired: China’s Internet Revolution (Marshall Cavendish, 2010); Structural Equation Modeling (Springer 2015);Financial Dynamics (Wiley 2003); Valuing Technology (Wiley 2002) and Financial Auditing with Information Technology (Credere, 2014).   I am the Editor-in-Chief of Electronic Commerce Research (Springer) and have served on editorial boards of several other information technology journals including Management Science, ISR, ECRA, IJEC, and others. I have served on the faculties at the University of Michigan, University of Southern California, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, University of Science and Technology of China, Harbin Institute of Technology and other academic institutions. In 2012 I received High-Level Foreign Expert status in China under the 1000-Talents Plan and am currently Overseas Chair Professor at Beihang University. I have advised on patent, valuation and technology strategy for numerous technology firms.</p>

						<h3>The Impact of R&D on Consumer Perceptions of Financial Products: Evidence from the "Digital Wallet" Industry</h3>
						<p>New product design and development is more often than not a crucial factor in the survival of a company. In an industry that is changing fast, firms must continually revise their design and range of products. This is necessary due to continuous technology change and development as well as other competitors and the changing preference of customers. Without an R&D program, a firm must rely on strategic alliances, acquisitions, and networks to tap into the innovations of others.</p>
						<p>Digital payments and payment containers (typically called “wallets”) have been an area of intense innovation over the past decade.  Indeed the proliferation of payment methods, patented technologies and technical innovations far exceeds the last great period of payments innovation in the 1960s when Diners Club, Visa and MasterCard vastly expanded their offerings. </p>
						<P>The current research answers basic questions regarding the dynamic processes governing IP protection, innovation law, market structure and evolution: in particular rates or entry and exit.  The research collected 449,145 twitter postings on consumer perceptions of digital wallet payment systems.  Automated lexical analysis was programmed for this research question, and applied to individual tweets to extract consumer sentiment.</P>
						<P>We found that patented R&D on customer-facing technologies (Bluetooth, SMS and QR codes) all increase the level and intensity of conversation on Twitter.  Patents related to architecture (SIM, SMS, RFID, barcodes) are not talked about (at least on general forums like Twitter; the story would probably be different at developer forums).</P>
